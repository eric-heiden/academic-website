abstract: "Planning smooth trajectories is important for the safe, efficient and
comfortable operation of mobile robots, such as wheeled robots moving in
crowded environments or cars moving at high speed. Asymptotically optimal
sampling-based motion planners can be used to generate such trajectories.
However, to achieve the necessary efficiency for the real-time
operation of robots, one often uses their initial feasible trajectories or the
trajectories of non-optimal motion planners instead, typically after a post-smoothing
step. We propose a gradient-informed post-smoothing algorithm, called GRIPS,
that deforms given trajectories by locally optimizing the placement of
vertices while satisfying the system's kinodynamic constraints.  We show
experimentally that GRIPS typically produces trajectories of significantly smaller length 
and higher smoothness than several existing post-smoothing
algorithms."

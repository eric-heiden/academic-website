I am a research scientist at NVIDIA, working on physics simulators and their applications in robotics.
My research is focused on reducing the sim2real gap. I am investigating simulators as semantic models of the world that can be updated from measurements. Such models are parameterized by physically meaningful variables and can enable robots to perform complex tasks.

I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the [University of Southern California (USC)](http://www.usc.edu") advised by [Gaurav Sukhatme](http://robotics.usc.edu/~gaurav/) and was supported by a [Google PhD Fellowship](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/10/announcing-2020-google-phd-fellows.html). I received a Master's degree from USC, and a Bachelor's degree from the [University of Rostock](https://www.uni-rostock.de/) (Germany).
